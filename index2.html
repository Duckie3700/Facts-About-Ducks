<p "text-align:center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, my name is Jayden Lee. This is my first ever website that I have made using the code language HTMl. There are three major 
coding languages that you need to use for coding a website. The main one is HTML. HTML is like the structure of the website. Just like when you build a house, you build it with nothing on it.
 Then there is CSS. CSS designs the website. CSS is like the paint and estetics on the house to make it look good. The last one is JavaScript. JavaScript makes the website
 easier to use. Just like the furniture in a house to make the house livable and comfterble.</p><br></br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>I have learned a couple of coding launguages in my time. I have learned scratch which is block based, python which is a regular coding launguage, and of course html and css which are 
 website development websites which is what I am using right now. I enjoy coding, and it makes me happy that I can be like many other people who are able to develop websites.
 Once you get the hang of it, it is pretty simple. Unless, however, you want to make a website like Youtube, which will require years of work and money.</p><br></br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p> I started coding when i was 7. Ever since then, my life has changed a whole lot, not only from coding, but other events that will not be listed here
 for privacy reasons. Technology always intrests me, especially computers. I hope one day I can make a laptop of my own. WITH THE POWER OF CODINGGGGGGG</p><h1><sup>pog</sup><sub>pOg</sub>
